### Developing a new website using backbone.
[The App](https://github.com/DanWeatherbee/PayRoll-App)

Looking for constructive input;
Hello everyone, I hope you are having a great day :)
I am working on a payroll app in the form of a modern single page web-app.
JavaScript - Library's; Backbone Framework using the browsers local storage.
Code is in no way refactored or refined at this point, styling comes later.
Hammering away at the functionality.
